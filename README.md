# lies-of-chatGPT
The Collection of ChatGPT's lies.

## Description
[OpenAI's ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) sometimes lies.
This repository collects the lies of ChatGPT.  
I think it's ok saying "I Don't know" or "I'm not sure" when ChatGPT doesn't know the answer but If it doesn't know the answer, it says lies.
